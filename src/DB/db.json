      "content": "Amid the coronavirus, 2020 was unpredictable in more ways than anyone would have expected. But one thing that stayed fairly constant was the steady flow of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) across the tech sector.\n\nGlobal tech M&A deals last year totalled $634 billion, a 91.8% year-over-year increase, according to GlobalData. Among a late flurry of big deals was the $35 billion acquisition of Xilinx by Advanced Micro Devices and Salesforce's $27.7 billion acquisition of Slack.\n\n[ Further reading: Biggest technology acquisitions of 2020 ]\nAs for whether 2021 will maintain last year’s pace, if the first part of the year is anything to go by, there will be no slowing of big deals across the industry, with silicon innovations and collaboration software already proving to be hot areas.",

      "content": "Cisco is adding new analytics features to its Webex collaboration platform that highlight working patterns at the personal, team, and organizational level.\n\nThe analytics – under the company’s People Insights brand – are designed to provide a variety of data from interactions within the Webex platform. It also uses information from the Cisco’s Webex Graph to track the relationships between staff at organizations using the collaboration platform, which contains video, call and team messaging features.\n\nPeople Insights initially focused on providing profile information for Webex meeting participants. The new features were unveiled this week.\n\n[ Related: How to manage group chat in the enterprise (hint: lightly) ]\nThe first to be available, “Personal Insights,” will provide workers with analytics about their own use of Webex and help track productivity and improve wellbeing, Cisco said. For instance, it can highlight the potential for burnout if an individual sets up too many back-to-back meetings without any focus time, or if they are frequently working extra hours outside of their scheduled routine.  Other features include the ability to suggest that users contact certain colleagues they may not have communicated with lately.\n\nIt can also highlight when a worker regularly arrives late to meetings, though Jeetu Patel, senior vice president and general manager for Security and Collaboration at Cisco, notes that the personal analytics data will not be available to managers. “They're not meant for your organization, they're not meant for your boss, they're not meant for your peers, it's only for you,” Patel said.\n\nHe added: “The goal is not to inspect [what workers are doing], the goal is to help you manage your well-being, your productivity and nurture your relationships.”",

The vast majority of those new listings defined themselves as technology companies.\n\nCloud-based software firms like Zoom, Snowflake, Asana, Airbnb and Palantir all performed particularly well, and continue to see their stock price flourish as remote work and e-commerce continue to be the norm for many into 2021.",

      "title": "What the hell is happening with Android One?",
      "content": "Not long ago, a low-profile program called Android One looked like it could be just the one-two punch Android needed.\n\nAndroid One, like lots of Google initiatives, has had a long and winding history with plenty of twists and turns. When Android One first came into the picture in 2014, it was described as an effort to \"make high-quality smartphones accessible to as many people as possible.\" The focus was squarely on bringing affordable phones with exceptional experiences to emerging markets — places like Pakistan and India, where it could be \"hard for people\" to \"get their hands on a high-quality smartphone,\" as Google put it at the time.\n\nBut that was just the start of Google's Android One ambitions. Three years later, in 2017, Google expanded the program with the launch of Android One phones in places like Japan, Taiwan, and eventually the United States. The company changed its description of the effort from that original small-scale focus to the much broader vision of a \"collaboration between Google and [its] partners to deliver a software experience designed by Google,\" with a guarantee of reasonably timely ongoing operating system updates and an experience that'd be free from all the bloat and shenanigans baked into so many Android products.\n\nSound familiar? It should. It's basically the same concept we see with Google's own self-made Pixel phones, only scaled down a bit and with other manufacturers involved. Or, to zoom back even further into Android nerdland, it's incredibly similar to what we used to see with Google's Nexus phones many moons ago — where Google would bring in other phone-makers to handle the hardware but then maintain complete control over the software, support, and overall user experience itself. (In the Nexus scenario, of course, the phones were branded as Google devices. But that surface-level distinction aside, the situation is almost eerily comparable.)",

      "content": "Slack moved quickly this week to make changes to its public direct messaging feature after a backlash highlighted the potential for harassment from people sending abusive messages.\n\nThe Slack Connect DM feature, unveiled in October, became generally available to all users of the platform on Wednesday. It enables Slack users to send an invite to someone outside of their Slack “workspace,” which, when accepted by the other party, allows direct messages to be exchanged in the chat app.\n\nThe invite is sent to the recipient’s email address with a button to “accept” the invitation. Prior to Slack’s changes, the sender could also include a text message to the recipient within the invite.\n\n[ Related: Slack vs. Teams: Which is best for your business? ]\nHowever, Twitter users quickly pointed out how the feature could be abused, with the ability to send harassing messages. Since the invite emails are sent from a single feedback@slack.com account — blocking them means all Connect DM invites are then marked as spam.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Slack said it would no longer allow messages to be added to Connect DM invites, thus preventing abusive ones from being included in the invite email.\n\n\"After rolling out Slack Connect DMs this morning, we received valuable feedback from our users about how email invitations to use the feature could potentially be used to send abusive or harassing messages,\" Jonathan Prince, Slack’s vice president of communications and policy, said in a Twitter post on Wednesday.",

      "content": "Spending on social and collaborative applications will likely see double-digit growth this year, according to a Gartner forecast, as businesses focus on keeping remote workers connected during the pandemic and beyond.\n\nWhile videoconferencing tools such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Cisco Webex were the big winners of the global shift to remote working during 2020, there has also been an uptick in interest in other types of platforms that connect workers and facilitate ad-hoc communications and “watercooler”-style interactions.\n\n[ Related: Remote working, now and forevermore? ]\nRevenues in three software market segments – collaborative work management, enterprise social networks. and employee communication software – are set to reach almost $4.5 billion in 2021, a 17% increase from $3.8 billion in 2020, according to Gartner’s “Forecast Analysis: Social and Collaboration Software in the Workplace, Worldwide.”  \n\nThe five-year revenue forecast predicts that revenues will increase by double-digit percentages each year to $6.9 billion in 2024; the research firm increased its long-term revenue growth forecast in comparison to its 2019 expectations due to the global shift toward remote work. Other drivers behind the increase include a rise in the number of knowledge workers globally, according to Gartner.\n\n“The need to suddenly empty out all the office buildings, while keeping businesses afloat, gave a jolt to many markets, with social and collaboration being one of those at the forefront,” said Craig Roth, research vice president at Gartner and one of the report’s authors. “Social and collaboration products went from ‘nice to have’ to ‘must have’ within a period of a few weeks.”",
